I created of a dynamic and interactive coffee sales dashboard using Excel. The objective is to provide a clear and insightful visualization of sales data, allowing users to analyze trends, identify patterns, and make informed decisions.

The dashboard includes a timeline, slicers, and various charts to filter and analyze the data. Users can explore sales trends over time, compare sales by country and coffee type, and identify top-performing customers. The dashboard also allows users to filter data by coffee roast type, size, and customer loyalty status.

This project showcases the power of Excel as a data analysis tool, demonstrating the ability to transform raw data into meaningful insights. This highlights the importance of data visualization in making data accessible and understandable.
